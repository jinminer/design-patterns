3. ### DAO Design Pattern

   DAO design pattern is used to decouple the data persistence logic to a separate layer. DAO is a very popular pattern when we design systems to work with databases.

5. ### Dependency Injection Pattern

   [Dependency Injection](https://www.journaldev.com/2394/java-dependency-injection-design-pattern-example-tutorial) allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable, and maintainable. We can implement dependency injection in java to move the dependency resolution from compile-time to runtime. Spring framework is built on the principle of dependency injection.
